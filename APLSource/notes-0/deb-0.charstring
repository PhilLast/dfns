rslt ← {blank} ##.deb argt                  ⍝ Drop Ending Blanks.

Both leading and trailing blanks are dropped from the character vector argument.
If the argument is of higher rank, blank "columns" are dropped.

Notice that:

    deb ≡≡ dlb∘⌽⍣2      ⍝ (John Daintree)

where ⍣ is the primitive power operator.
