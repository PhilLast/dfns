cmp ← {cmp←1} ##.packS exp                  ⍝ Shannon-Fano packing.

The  Shannon-Fano  algorithm is a variant of Huffman-coding, where the most fre-
quent item is replaced with the shortest key.

Suitable for text packing, but alas, unpacking is s-l-o-w in APL (unless someone
invents a really good way to do that).

Because  the  indices are of variable length, expansion is pretty slow (and bor-
ing).
