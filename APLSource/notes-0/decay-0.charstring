Decay
¯¯¯¯¯
Cans of soup at the back of the cupboard decay into cans of tomato soup.

Non-soup cans decay into cans of either chickpeas or red kidney beans.

Pencils of grade HB or better decay into 2H or worse.

High-value coins decay into low-value coins and bank notes into pocket fluff.

And so things go.
